##### Musicity is an AR/3d experience that aimed to help people have immersive traveling planning experience. It is based on a scenario that people have problem with travling planning or people who are extremlly into the music.

### Original idea
The orginal ideal is to encourage elderly to have a virtal social experience based on their preference music type.  

### Developed idea
The target user can be anyone who can accesse to the website or app. And Xiangsong decided to encourgae people to share musical recording from their nearby places. The concept of community is critical for this project.

### Developed process
There are two main parts of the development. Map and UI

#### Map
Mapbox JS is the seleted web map API.

The process of getting used to the MAPBOX JS is not as smooth as Xiangsong expect.
After a long time, Xiangsogn started to feel fammilar with the API.

#### UI
The UI and UX flow was simulated in Balsamiq Mock up.

#### Future
The current state of the project is having a demo on the website. The next step will be merge the UI with the frontend. Unfortunatly, UAL blocked the site for the most of the time. It is quite hard to develop in the bunker where Xiangsong stays. But Xiangsong had made a plan to make further deverlopment with the master student in HCI from Geogia Tech, also, try to bring the website online.
