Musicity is an AR/3d experience that aimed to help people have immersive traveling planning experience. It is based on a scenario that people have problem with travling planning or people who are extremlly into the music.
### Original idea
The orginal ideal is to encourage elderly to have a virtal social experience based on their preference music type.  

### Developed idea
The target user can be anyone who can accesse to the website or app. And Xiangsong decided to encourgae people to share musical recording from their nearby places. The concept of community is critical for this project.

### Developed process
There are two main parts of the development. Map and UI

The process of getting used to the MAPBOX JS is not as smooth as Xiangsong expect.
After a long time, Xiangsogn started to feel fammilar with the API.

#### UI
The UI and UX flow was simulated in Balsamiq Mock up.
